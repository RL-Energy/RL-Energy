## Introduction
A reinforcement learning (RL) based automated system for chemical engineering systems conceptual design is introduced and demonstrated. An artificial intelligence (AI) agent performs the conceptual design by automatically deciding which process-units are necessary for the desired system, picking the process-units from the candidate process-units pool (CPP), connecting them together, and optimizing the operation of the system for the user-defined system performance targets. The AI agent automatically selects units from the user-defined CPPs, connects them to construct flowsheets, and optimizes the system design according to the userâ€™s desired objective. The AI agent automatically interacts with a physics-based system-level modeling and simulation toolset, the Institute for the Design of Advanced Energy System (IDAES) Integrated Platform, to guarantee the system design is physically consistent.
